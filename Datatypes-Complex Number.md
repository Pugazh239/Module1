# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## 💻 Program
```
real_part = float(input())
imaginary_part = float(input())
complex_number = complex(real_part, imaginary_part)

print(complex_number)
print(complex_number.real)
```


## Output
![438229717-54a48a7f-2648-4e4e-855f-0044b5fc793d](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a896fd18-15ad-42fa-9272-713e115e4855)


## Result
Thus,the python program was executed successfully
